# synthesis-scala-bus

This is a possible solution to the [homework assignment in CS252R Program Synthesis (Fall 2023)](https://synthesis.metareflection.club/assignments.html).

It implements a bottom-up synthesizer which is generic in the language it targets, and it offers three languages: a subset of Scheme, a DSL for string manipulation, and a DSL for arithmetic expressions.

Use `sbt test` to try it out.
